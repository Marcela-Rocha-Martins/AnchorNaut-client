# Anchornaut - Full Stack Web Application

Anchornaut is a full-stack project that empowers you to turn your wildest dreams into achievable and concrete personal projects. The platform leverages the OpenAI GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) chat API to create a dynamic system where users can input their dreams, and the AI generates tasks and subtasks to help bring those dreams to life. The project includes both a backend and a front-end component.

Here's a breakdown of the key technologies and components powering the project:

## Backend - Project Management Server

### UI Components and Styling

The frontend is developed using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. UI components are enriched with libraries such as Framer Motion for animations and FontAwesome for scalable vector icons. 

### State Management and Routing

React Router Dom is utilized for client-side routing, allowing seamless navigation within the application. State management is facilitated by React hooks and the broader React ecosystem.

### Data Fetching

Axios is employed for making HTTP requests, enabling the frontend to interact with the backend API. This ensures smooth communication between the user interface and the server.
