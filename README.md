## Frontend - React

### UI Components and Styling

The frontend is developed using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. UI components are enriched with libraries such as Framer Motion for animations and FontAwesome for scalable vector icons. 

### State Management and Routing

React Router Dom is utilized for client-side routing, allowing seamless navigation within the application. State management is facilitated by React hooks and the broader React ecosystem.

### Data Fetching

Axios is employed for making HTTP requests, enabling the frontend to interact with the backend API. This ensures smooth communication between the user interface and the server.
